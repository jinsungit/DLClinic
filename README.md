# Deep Learning Clinic (DLC)

## Course Description
This class provides an introduction to theories and techniques that are essential in solving practical problems with deep learning.

After the fundamental materials, the instructor will have one-on-one analysis with students to help them tackle challenges in applying deep learning on real world problems, including: feasibility evaluation, modeling and task formulation, identify and design suitable network architectures, and practical guidance on training and turning neural network models.

This course is designed for students who are eager to solve complex real world problems with powerful machine learning algorithms, yet have trouble in various stages of the process.

### What this course is not
This is *not* a machine learning or deep learning introductory course. Although fundamental materials of those subjects are to be reviewed, they will be covered in a concise manner thus students are expected to already have basic understanding of machine learning concepts (See Prerequisites below for details).
