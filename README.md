# Deep Learning Clinic (DLC) Syllabus

## Course Description
Welcome to the Deep Learning Clinic (DLC) 2018!


### Who DLC Is For

This course is designed for students who are eager to solve complex real world problems with powerful machine learning algorithms, yet need advice on and help with various stages of this process -- what tools to use, how to use them, and practical advice.

### What DLC Is About

DLC has meetings with two formats: an instructional session (Friday) focusing on the essential knowledge to get started with real-world examples, and a lab session (Wednesday) that provides hands-on exercises and feedback.

The lectures provide a concise introduction to techniques and tools that are essential in solving practical problems with deep learning algorithms.

In the lab session, students are encouraged to work on their own projects that using deep learning. The instructor will have one-on-one analysis with the students to help them tackle challenges raised, including: feasibility evaluation, modeling and task formulation, network architectures searching and designing, and practical guidance on training and tuning neural network models.

### What DLC Is Not
This is *not* a machine learning or deep learning introductory course. Although fundamental materials of those subjects are to be reviewed, they will be covered in a concise manner thus students are expected to already have basic understanding of machine learning concepts (See Prerequisites below for details).

## Lecture Plan (Dates are tentative)

### 9/28 - Course Introduction

Overview of the course and syllabus outlining what students can expect from the course.

Exploration of a simple learning problem (http://playground.tensorflow.org) to show students the essential steps in solving a machine learning problem.

Class survey on students' background and interested topics.


### 10/5 - Deep Learning Frameworks

Step-by-step introduction on how to set up a deep learning-ready computing environment and how and when to use popular frameworks and tools, including:

[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)

[Keras](https://keras.io/)

[Tensorboard for visualization](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/04-utils/tensorboard)

After this lecture, the students should have a working DL environment and be ready to explore the usage of these tools.

### 10/26 - Deep Learning in Real World: A Case Study

A case study on how to: identify a real world problem, collect data, design models, train and evaluate.



### 11/2 - Data

How to perform data related tasks such as collection, labeling, and verification.

Details on how to set up data labeling tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turks.


### 11/9 - Tricks on Training Neural Networks

Practical tips and tricks on how to train a (good) neural network model, including: pre-processing, post-processing, learning rate, batch size, normalization, network depth, choice between architectures, fine-tuning, and etc.



### 11/16 Real-World Ready Machine Learning Tools
