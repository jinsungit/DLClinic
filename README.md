## Course Description
Welcome to the Deep Learning Clinic (DLC) 2018!


### Who DLC Is For

This course is designed for students who are eager to solve complex real world problems with powerful machine learning algorithms, yet need advice on and help with various stages of this process -- what tools to use, how to use them, and practical advice.

### What DLC Is About

DLC has meetings with two formats: an instructional session (Friday) focusing on the essential knowledge to get started with real-world examples, and a lab session (Wednesday) that provides hands-on exercises and feedback.

The lectures provide a concise introduction to techniques and tools that are essential in solving practical problems with deep learning algorithms.

In the lab session, students are encouraged to work on their own projects that using deep learning. The instructor will have one-on-one analysis with the students to help them tackle challenges raised, including: feasibility evaluation, modeling and task formulation, network architectures searching and designing, and practical guidance on training and tuning neural network models.


### What DLC Is Not

This is *not* a machine learning or deep learning introductory course. Although fundamental materials of those subjects are to be reviewed, they will be covered in a concise manner. Students who are unfamiliar with machine learning or deep learning are encouraged to read the Reference section below for a more comprehensive understanding of the relevant topics.
