# Deep Learning Clinic (DLC) Syllabus

## Course Description
Welcome to the Deep Learning Clinic (DLC) 2018!


### Who DLC Is For

This course is designed for students who are eager to solve complex real world problems with powerful machine learning algorithms, yet need advises and help in various stages of such process.

### What DLC Is About

DLC contains two formats of a learning experience: a lecture session focuses on the essential knowledge to get started; and a lab session that provides hands-on exercises and feedback.

The lectures provide a concise introduction to theories and techniques that are essential in solving practical problems with deep learning algorithms.

In the lab session, students are encouraged to work on their own projects that using deep learning. The instructor will have one-on-one analysis with the students to help them tackle challenges raised, including: feasibility evaluation, modeling and task formulation, network architectures searching and designing, and practical guidance on training and tuning neural network models.

### What DLC Is Not
This is *not* a machine learning or deep learning introductory course. Although fundamental materials of those subjects are to be reviewed, they will be covered in a concise manner thus students are expected to already have basic understanding of machine learning concepts (See Prerequisites below for details).
